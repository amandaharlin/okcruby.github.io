    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>February 13th Meeting</h4>

<p>Buckle up your SSH certs, because we&rsquo;re launching February with a talk on Capistrano.</p>

<p>Kelly Mahan is going to bring us the following: With our move to ruby and rails we needed a better way to deploy our applications to remote servers. Capistrano is a better way. I&rsquo;ll walkthrough a simple standard setup. Then I&rsquo;ll show off some of our more complex deployment scripts and automation. Finally I&rsquo;ll touch on some of the new stuff with Capistrano 3 and the direction that it is heading.ï»¿</p>

<p>Kelly Mahan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kmahan">t</a>) will be the voice box for this talk. He&rsquo;s have been a professional web developer / jack of all trades for the past 16 years, but programming since way back when the TRS-80 and tape decks were all the rage. He started out with windows servers, asp, access databases, then picked up flash action-script and javascript to round out my interface skills. Around 2006 while working at Digimedia.com, the dev team made a group decision to learn rails. Ruby is still his development tool of choice with rails my goto for more complex web applications.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who came to the first meeting.  We were blown
away by the turn out.  When we first started plannig the meeting we
guessed that there might be around 15-20 people in attendance.  The
actual number today was about 40, and everyone was very enthusiastic.<br/>
It&rsquo;s really awesome to see so much excitement in the local Ruby community.</p>

<p>Here are links to the slides for todays presentations.</p>

to change that. Starting October 10th, we&rsquo;re going to be meeting the 2nd Thursday of each

<p>The lovable Octocats at Github are going to be sponsoring this meeting and providing lunch so the only thing required from you is to show up and learn.</p>

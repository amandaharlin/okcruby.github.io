## June 12th Meeting

Interested in how you can take your ruby skills and get the #1 paid app in the Apple App Store? We are too! That is why we've summoned Amir Rajan ([b][b]/[t][t]) to talk about RubyMotion and his app "[A Dark Room][darkroom]".  Amir will show us the beauty and elegance of using ruby instead of objective-c to build your app as well as the meteoric rise of A Dark Room.

Amir ([b][b]/[t][t]) is a polyglot superstar. Having cut his teeth in the deep waters of .Net, Amir has also sailed his code-ship into the watery regions of Nodejs, Ruby, objective C and others. Showing his commitment to okcruby, he will pack up nearly all of his possessions and travel to tell us about his odyssey with A Dark Room.

Location: [Prototek][prototek]
Time: 11:30 - 12:30

{Jeremy, Michael, Paul, Rob}

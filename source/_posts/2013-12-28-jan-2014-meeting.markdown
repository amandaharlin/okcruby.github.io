#### January 09th Meeting

Hold on to your queries, the [Brightbit][2] superstars are going to show us how they put on their hard hats and turn active record into their pick axe.

Theme of the meeting is "How Brightbit constructs complex database queries with Active Record" and here is a little more about [Brightbit][3]:

Jonathan Camenisch ([t][]) will be the voice box for this talk. He has been building software of various kinds for about 20 years. He now helps Brightbit build web applications, usually on Rails. He likes learning about different programming paradigms and then finding excuses to smash them together.

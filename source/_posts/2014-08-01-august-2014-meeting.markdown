### August 14th Meeting

This month we'll have a special guest presenting for us from Seattle.
[Matt Kirk][mjkirk] will give us a dose of machine learning on the topic of building (and testing)
sentiment analysis using support vector machines in Ruby.  This is sure
to be an interesting session that you won't want to miss.

[Matt][mjkirk] is the author of the upcoming O'Reilly book 
[Thoughtful Machine Learning](http://signup.thoughtfulml.com/). He's
also a partner at [Modulus 7](http://modulus7.com/), a change management
consultancy in Seattle, WA.  When he's not teaching machines to
learn or people to change, you might find him travelling or enjoying (or expanding) his 2,000+(!!) collection of vinyl records.




Location: [Prototek][prototek]
Time: 11:30 - 12:30

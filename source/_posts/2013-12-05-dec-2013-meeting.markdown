#### December 12th Meeting

We have a double header of ruby goodness from frontend to backend!

Starting things off, Jeremy Green ([@jagthedrummer][2]) will have a cage match with Resque and Sidekiq. Who will come out on top? Come and find out.

After that, Grant Schofield ([@schofield][3]) will be breaking down JRuby and Trinidad. He and his team of giraffes broke away from MRI and will be showing us what they have learned from the school of hard ops.

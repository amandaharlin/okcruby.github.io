#### April 10th Meeting

This month, we're celebrating Railsconf by having our own Railsconf speaker Jeremy Green talk about Service Oriented Authentication. Getting started with authentication in SOA environments can seem like a daunting subject, but it doesn't need to be difficult. This talk will cover everything you need to know to get started building your own SOA systems. We'll look at the details of building a centralized authentication service and allowing other apps to delegate their authentication needs to the service.

Jeremy ([@jagthedrummer][t] / [Octolabs][b]) is a full stack engineer who has been creating web apps for over 15 years. He's an organizer of the OkcRuby developer group and an active open source contributor. You might also find him drumming, shooting photos, or brewing.

Location: [The Exchange][exchange]
Time: 11:30 - 12:30
